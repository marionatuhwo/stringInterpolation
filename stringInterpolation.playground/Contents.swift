//(Source: Apple Documentation) String Interpolation is a way to construct a new String value from a mix of constants, variables, literals, expressions by including their values inside a string literal. Each item that you insert into the string literal is wrapped in a pair of parentheses prefixed by a backslash \

//Let's run through an example:

var personName = "Tom"

//string interpolation example

let greeting = "Hi, my name is \(personName)"
